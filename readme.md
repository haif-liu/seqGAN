Paper: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06547]()

See [TensorFlow Neural Machine Translation Tutorial](https://github.com/tensorflow/nmt) for more about implementation. 

This project still lacks a lot of components, but it receives attention far more than I expected. So these days I will make some enhancements to this project. 

In the following days, I will: 

* upload some results
* fix some bugs to make it reproducible
